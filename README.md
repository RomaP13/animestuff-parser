# Novel Website Parser

This project is a parser for a novel website designed to enhance the search and retrieval of novels.
The website's native tools are insufficient for efficient searching, so this parser offers an improved solution.
It supports both synchronous and asynchronous parsing, with the async parser being approximately 8 times faster.
